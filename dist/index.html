                About Me
            </h2>
            <p>I am a junior web developer currently enrolled in the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp. Before entering this program, I was a student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville studying engineering. During my tenure at the University I enlisted in the Air National Guard as an Emergency Manager and have served for the past 7 years. Through this period I have had the opportunity to be in two different positions on McGhee Tyson ANG Base and have transitioned between two other jobs in the civilian world. I am a dedicated individual who wants to make an impact wherever I'm at. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and to improve myself. </p>

                        <p>This is a very basic game that allows you to fight virtual robots from your webpage. You will start off with health and a score and will be taken through different battles. Along the way, you will be allowed to go into the shop to buy upgarades and health in order to beat your next opponent. Good luck!</p>
